# Agile Methodologies    

Book Nook is my second project where I followed Agile planning methods by myself. I had done it for my portfolio project 4 and also participated in Code Institute's March Hackathon. These experiences helped me a lot as I already knew how it works. I used my Github Projects Board to plan and document all of my work. 

### MoSCoW Prioritization    

I followed the MoSCoW Prioritization method for Book Nook project by identifying and labelling my:

- Must Haves: the 'required', critical components of the project. Completing my 'Must Haves' helped me to reach the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this project early, allowing me to develop the project further than originally planned.

- Should Haves: the components that are valuable to the project but not absolutely 'vital' at the MVP stage. The 'Must Haves' must receive priority over the 'Should Haves'.

- Could Haves: these are the features that are a 'bonus' to the project, it would be nice to have them in this phase, but only if the most important issues have been completed first and time allows.

- Won't Haves: the features or components that either no longer fit the project's brief or are of very low priority for this release.

### User Stories    

All the user stories have been added to the Project Board with the required fields like title, description, acceptance criteria, tasks, labels, project, milestone etc. The user stories were moved across the board through stages like To Do, In Progress and Done during the development of the project. Please find below screenshots for the user story board and issues:
